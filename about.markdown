## Hello, I'm Robert Taylor

Software engineer, traveler, and technology enthusiast currently exploring Taiwan while building innovative tech projects. After several years working in the Bay Area, I decided to take a sabbatical to explore new places and technologies.

### Professional Background

I specialize in:
- Cloud architecture and AWS services
- Mobile app enablement (backend services for Android an iOS)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- AI-assisted development

### Current Projects

During my travels, I've been exploring the intersection of AI, cloud services, and mobile development. Some recent projects include:

- **Personal VPN Control System**: A complete solution for deploying and managing a personal VPN service using AWS, Terraform, and iOS
- **TerrorTunnels**: Privacy-focused communication tools for travelers
- **AI-Generated Development**: Experimenting with AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude for code generation

### Travel & Adventure

My sabbatical in Taiwan has taken me through:
- Jiufen
- Keelung
- Kaohsiung
- Tainan
- Xiding Mountains
- Taipei

Each location deserves its own blog post. Hmm...

### Why "Robot Terror"?

The name combines my interest in automation and AI ("Robot") with a playful nod to the sometimes concerning implications of technology ("Terror"). It's a reminder to build technology mindfully, with awareness of both its benefits and potential risks. And, it's a malapropism of my given name "Robert Taylor".
